You can update team strength, player values on updated_player_data.py. Then all you need to run expectedpoints.py, which will create final_player_data with fixture based projections. Then at main.py you can solve with the settings as you wish. That's pretty much it.
Edit: Before the season use mainwildcard.py to solve, also expected minutes are so basic right now, it is just taken average based on 3 sources for predicted 11; so use it accordingly.
